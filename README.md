# GeometricComplexity

First implementation of optimal dimensional reduction for PCA using Geometric Complexity.

The implementation was done by Serena Di Giorgio.

The method is compared with other approaches in synthetic and benchmark datasets from the UCI repository.

You can find a print of the iphyton file in pdf format [here](/print.pdf).

The technique was introduced in: 

B. Mera, P. Mateus and A. Carvalho, *Model complexity in statistical manifolds: the role of curvature*. Submitted for publication, 2021.
